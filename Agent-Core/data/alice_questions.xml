It was the footsteps of the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something. Very soon as the rabbit saw me, it asked to give the gloves and the fan back. I did and followed the rabbit into a tidy little room with a table in the window. I was just going to leave the room, when my eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time, but I drank it anyway. I knew SOMETHING interesting was sure to happen. I drank and hoped that it would get me a little bigger. It did so indeed, and much sooner than I had expected. There even seemed to be no sort of chance of me ever getting out of the room again, I felt unhappy. The rabbit, knowing that I couldn't get out of the room, called Bill.

In short, I was feeling bored while sitting on the riverbank with my elder sister, who is reading a book with no pictures or conversations. I then notice a talking White Rabbit with a pocket watch run past. I follow it down a rabbit hole, but suddenly fall a long way down, into a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. I find a small key to a door too small for me to fit through, but through it I see an nice garden. I then discover a bottle on a table labelled DRINK ME, the contents of which caused me to shrink too small to reach the key, which I had left on the table. I eat a cake with EAT ME written on it. That is what happens in chapter one.
